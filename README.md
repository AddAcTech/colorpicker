I decided to make this proyect as my first Chromium Extension.
To start using it follow the next steps (for Chrome browser):
1.  Clone this repository
2.  Go to chrome://extensions/
3.  Enable the developer mode in the right top corner
4.  Click on "Load unpacked"
5.  Select the extension folder
   
Now yo can use the extension.
Open the extension and click the color you want to pick. You will see the Hexadecimal code in the extension and it also has been copied to clipboard
